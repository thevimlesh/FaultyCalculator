Faulty Calculator üé≠

This is a fun and quirky calculator designed to challenge your mathematical skills. Unlike a regular calculator, this Faulty Calculator intentionally provides incorrect results occasionally or manipulates operations to keep you on your toes. Perfect for those who believe they don't need a calculator‚Äîor want to test their programming or math expertise!

Features üîß
Basic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. (Or so it seems!) 

Faulty Logic:
Operations are deliberately swapped:
Addition ‚û°Ô∏è Performs subtraction
Subtraction ‚û°Ô∏è Performs division
Multiplication ‚û°Ô∏è Performs addition
Division ‚û°Ô∏è Exponentiation
Additionally, there‚Äôs a 10% chance of introducing a random error to make the result slightly off! üé≤

Minimalist UI: A simple and interactive interface for quick calculations.

Fun Message: Reminds you that it's for "intelligent people who don't need a calculator."

How It Works üõ†Ô∏è
Enter Two Numbers: Input the first and second numbers into the designated fields.
Choose an Operation: Select from addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Hit Calculate: Click the "Calculate" button to see the result.
Spot the Error: If the result seems off, double-check your math to catch the "fault."
